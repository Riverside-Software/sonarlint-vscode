# CABL for VS Code

Connect to [SonarQube Server](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/) or [SonarQube Cloud](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/) (you can create a [free SonarQube Cloud account](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) to get started), to create a powerful, unified code quality platform for your team, throughout the software development lifecycle. [This connection](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-for-vs-code/team-features/connected-mode/) enables sharing of consistent language rulesets and project settings, and unlocks analysis of deeply hidden security issues, fostering collaboration and code uniformity. Additionally, Connected Mode unlocks analysis of languages such as COBOL, Apex, PL/SQL, T-SQL, and Ansible.
This extension is a fork of the official SonarQube for IDE extension by [SonarSource](https://www.sonarsource.com/) to analyze OpenEdge ABL code. The [standard extension by SonarSource](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode) must be installed to analyze any other language.

CABL depends on [the Riverside Software extension for ABL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RiversideSoftware.openedge-abl-lsp).
